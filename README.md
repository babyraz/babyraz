Hi there 👋

I’m a 32-year-old frontend development student based in Malmö, Sweden.
Before diving into tech, I worked as a social worker (socionom), where I gained valuable experience in collaboration, communication, and problem-solving — skills I now bring into my development journey.

🌱 What I’m up to

Studying frontend development with a focus on building user-friendly, accessible, and responsive web applications.

Exploring modern tools and frameworks to grow as a developer.

🤝 What I enjoy

Teamwork & collaboration – I thrive when working together toward shared goals.

Sharing knowledge and learning from others.

🎮 Outside of coding

Video games (always up for recommendations 🎧).

Making music.

Movies & TV shows.
